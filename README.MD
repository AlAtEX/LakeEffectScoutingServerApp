# Lake Effect Server Scouting App

This is the server side of the scouting app built for FIRST Robotics team Lake Effect Robotics. This app pulls data from 6 devices using the client app and puts all the data into one.

# Versions

The versions are not backwards compatible. Please use the same version of server app as you do client app.

# Building

There is currently no pre-built version. 

Clone the repository and open it with Android Studio. This repository requires no extra libraries.

The device must support bluetooth to use this app, or else the app will not function at all.

Make sure to use the same versions of the server and client are used, or else there may be unintended consequences.
